# Next.js 15 Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 related to navigation between pages.  The application consists of two pages, `Home` and `About`, linked via a simple `next/link` component.  However, navigating to the `About` page from the `Home` page does not correctly render the `About` page content.

## Bug Description

The `About` page fails to render when clicking the link. The behavior is inconsistent, sometimes displaying a blank page and other times showing errors or unexpected content. This issue only occurs in Next.js 15; previous versions worked fine.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `About` page from the `Home` page.
5. Observe the unexpected behavior.

## Potential Causes

The issue may stem from how Next.js 15 handles page routing or the interaction between client-side rendering and the `next/link` component. Further investigation is needed.

## Solution

The solution involves adding the `prefetch` prop in the Link component. This allows the browser to preload the About page which is the cause of the problem when accessing this page.
